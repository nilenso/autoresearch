"""Private copies of the tool, so experiments can't tread on each other.

A git worktree is a second checkout of the same repository in another folder.
We give each worker its own, write the candidate version of the file into it,
and run the questions there. Nothing we do touches your real checkout.

Worktrees are reused rather than recreated. Making one costs a few seconds
(mostly installing dependencies), and GEPA will evaluate hundreds of
candidates, so rebuilding every time would dominate the run.
